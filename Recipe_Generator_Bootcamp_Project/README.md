## server setup steps
1. install dependencies `npm i` (shorthand for `npm install`)(you may also need to install node js from the website if you haven't already)
2. make your .env file `cp .env.defaults .env` and set api key(see below to get key from website) `SERP_API_KEY=`
3. start server `node app` or `npx nodemon`(so it updates every time you edit the code)

`ctrl + c` to stop server
## API KEY
To get the api key, go to serpapi.com, scroll down to easy integration, and in the uri grab the api key portion of that uri.
